# 🧬 Decentralized Generational Identity (DGI)

A blockchain-based identity management system that links users to their ancestors, enabling encrypted, decentralized, and privacy-preserving storage and access of personal data across generations.

---

## 📌 Overview

This project allows individuals to create **unique digital identities** tied to their family lineage, validated by **trusted family members** rather than third parties. It uses Ethereum-compatible smart contracts (Polygon), IPFS for decentralized file storage, and Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) to protect sensitive information while allowing anonymous verification.

---

## ✨ Key Features

* 🔗 **Generational Identity Linking**: Every identity is connected to ancestors via a decentralized family tree structure.
* 🛡️ **Zero-Knowledge Proof Authentication**: Verify identities or login anonymously without exposing personal information.
* 👪 **Family-Based Validation**: Verified by mother, father, and grandparent (2/3 consensus required for updates).
* 🗂️ **Encrypted File Storage on IPFS**: Store documents, images, or data files securely and immutably.
* 🧠 **Custom Validation Pool**: Users revalidate every 6 months using a Q\&A system; failure results in revoked rights.
* ⏳ **Time-Limited Data Access**: Grant data access to others for a specific period with complete control.
* 🧑‍💻 **EVM-Compatible Smart Contracts**: Built with Solidity and deployable on Polygon for scalability and cost-efficiency.
* 🕵️ **Privacy-Preserving Profile Sharing**: Default data visibility is restricted; unauthorized users see only avatars.

## 🧪 How It Works

1. **Identity Creation**
   Users register by submitting their data and getting verified by 3 family members (Mom, Dad, Grandparent).

2. **Data Storage**
   Files are encrypted and stored on IPFS. Metadata is recorded in the smart contract.

3. **Validation Cycle**
   Every 6 months, users must pass a custom Q\&A validation (≥75% score). Validity lasts up to 18 months.

4. **Access Control**
   Other users can request access using immutable smart contract addresses. Owners approve or reject with optional time limits.

5. **Decentralized Legacy**
   Users decide which files to pass on to descendants, preserving family wisdom securely.

## ✅ Advantages

* Fully decentralized identity verification.
* Transparent but private data sharing.
* Eliminates third-party reliance.
* Immutable family tree for ancestry tracking.
* Scalable and low-cost deployment with Polygon.

---

## ⚠️ Limitations

* Initial manual verification required to bootstrap the family tree.
* Complex tree updates in marriage/legal transitions.
* Access permissions require manual time limits; indefinite access possible if not set.
* Non-blood relationships can complicate legal accountability.

---

## 🔮 Future Work

* Add **advanced encryption techniques** for even stronger privacy.
* Build **user-friendly dashboards** for non-technical users.
* Integrate with **eCommerce and Web3 platforms** for seamless identity use.
* Consider **longer lifespan models** in anticipation of extended human life expectancy.
